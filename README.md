# cash-flow-manager

Create a budgeting app that supports the following user stories:

â€¢ Adding a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type
(income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g groceries, bills, salary), so that I can
keep track of my financial activities.
â€¢ View a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and
category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.
â€¢ Edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is
needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.
â€¢ Delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that
my financial records are up to date.
